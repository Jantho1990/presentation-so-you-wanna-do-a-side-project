# So, You Wanna Do a Side Project?

This is the github repo for Josh Anthony's _So, You Wanna Do a Side Project_ presentation,
to be presented at Minnebar 19 (2025).

Built using Godot 4.4, based on the Stop Waiting for Godot presentation. Includes a partially-baked system for making presentations,
including use of stepped animations. In theory, this could be expanded upon and
made a proper presentation software. I don't intend to do that at this time.

## Maintenance

There is no maintenance. You are welcome to download the repo and use it as an
example for your own purposes, but I have no intention of maintaining this repo.
(I've got games to make, after all!)

That said, if someone does open a PR, for whatever reason, I may look at it
someday. Just not promising to make it a habit. :P
