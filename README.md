# Stop Waiting For Godot: Introducing You to the Godot Game Engine

This is the github repo for Josh Anthony's _Stop Waiting for Godot_ presentation,
originally presented for IGDA Twin Cities on 11/8/2023.

Built using Godot 4.1. Includes a partially-baked system for making presentations,
including use of stepped animations. In theory, this could be expanded upon and
made a proper presentation software. I don't intend to do that at this time.

## Maintenance

There is no maintenance. You are welcome to download the repo and use it as an
example for your own purposes, but I have no intention of maintaining this repo.
(I've got games to make, after all!)

That said, if someone does open a PR, for whatever reason, I may look at it
someday. Just not promising to make it a habit. :P
